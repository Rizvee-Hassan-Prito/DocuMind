The Industrial Revolution marked a significant turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. Beginning in the late 18th century in Britain, 
it quickly spread to Europe, North America, and eventually the world.

Initial developments included mechanized textile production, steam engines, and improved iron manufacturing techniques. This era also brought about mass urbanization, 
as people moved to cities for factory jobs.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the Second Industrial Revolution introduced electricity, the internal combustion engine, and telecommunication innovations like the telegraph 
and telephone. These advancements laid the groundwork for the modern technological society.

By transforming economies and societies globally, the Industrial Revolution is often considered one of the most profound shifts in human history.
